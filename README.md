DESCRIPTION
---------------
The main idea behind this project is to implement an SMS based search tool which
can provide extreme functionality for internet search access.

We aim to provide search functionality based on some sort of pre-defined query syntax.
An example of this may be something along the lines of getting bus route directions


Ex.
# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #
# --startpoint --endpoint --arrival-time     #
#										     #
# --123 main street --456 old road --12:50pm #
# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

This sort of example should return a detailed list of directions similar to what google maps would provide.

- Walk to Main St and Next St (ETA 12:30pm)
- Take the 10 Bus to Old Street (ETA 12:45pm)
- Walk to 456 old road (ETA 12:50pm)


We would also like to provide quick on-the-go basic searches like:
"What colour are monarch butterflies?"
"What day of the week is November 4th 2017?"
"What time is it in Shanghai, China?"
